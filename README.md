# Kube code generator [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/slok/kube-code-generator/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/slok/kube-code-generator)

A kubernetes code generator ready container to create your CRD autogenerated code like clients or openapi specs.

This uses the [official util](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator) created by Kubernetes to autogenerate the code required by Kubernetes resources.

## Kubernetes type code generation

### Env vars required

- `PROJECT_PACKAGE`: The project package path.
- `CLIENT_GENERATOR_OUT`: The client generated out path.
- `APIS_ROOT`: The path where our API/resources are.
- `GROUPS_VERSION`: The groups of the resources.
- `GENERATION_TARGETS`: The wanted generated code. [(deepcopy,defaulter,client,lister,informer) or "all"].

### Process

Having a project that would be on `github.com/someone/myproject`, wants to generate the client on `github.com/someone/myproject/client`, has its resources on `github.com/someone/myproject/apis`, has the resources `github.com/someone/myproject/apis/test/v1alpha1` and `github.com/someone/myproject/apis/test2/v1` and wants only `deepcopy` and `client` autogenerated code this would be:

```bash
PROJECT_PACKAGE=github.com/someone/myproject && \
docker run -it --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/go/src/${PROJECT_PACKAGE}\
    -e PROJECT_PACKAGE=${PROJECT_PACKAGE} \
    -e CLIENT_GENERATOR_OUT=${PROJECT_PACKAGE}/client \
    -e APIS_ROOT=${PROJECT_PACKAGE}/apis \
    -e GROUPS_VERSION="test:v1alpha1 test2:v1" \
    -e GENERATION_TARGETS="deepcopy,client" \
    quay.io/slok/kube-code-generator
```

## Kubernetes type openapi spec generation

### Env vars required

- `CRD_PACKAGES`: The packages where all the CRD types are (comma separated).
- `OPENAPI_OUTPUT_PACKAGE`: The output package where the open api spec will be created.

### Process

Having a project that would be on `github.com/someone/myproject`, wants to generate the openapi spec for its types on `github.com/someone/myproject/openapi`, has its resources on `github.com/someone/myproject/apis`, has the resources `github.com/someone/myproject/apis/test/v1alpha1` and `github.com/someone/myproject/apis/test2/v1` autogenerated spec this would be:

```bash
PROJECT_PACKAGE=github.com/someone/myproject && \
docker run -it --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/go/src/${PROJECT_PACKAGE}\
    -e CRD_PACKAGES=${PROJECT_PACKAGE}/apis/test/v1alpha1,${PROJECT_PACKAGE}/apis/test2/v1 \
    -e OPENAPI_OUTPUT_PACKAGE=${PROJECT_PACKAGE}/openapi \
    quay.io/slok/kube-code-generator ./update-openapi.sh
```

## Example

You have a project example in [example](example/) path.
